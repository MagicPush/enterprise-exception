# HOWTO for dummies and experienced

This guide contains instructions and explanations about the **EnterpriseException** library classes.

The _dummies_ section describes all functionality basics like how all this work in short
and minimal setup instructions.

The _experienced_ section describes additional functionality you can configure or add. Some complicated cases are
discussed in that section as well.

- [Basic usage (or the _dummies_ section)](dummies/about.md)
    - [GlobalException](dummies/global-exception.md)
    - [CustomizableException](dummies/customizable-exception.md)
    - [Parser](dummies/parser.md)
- [Mastering enterprise exceptions (or the _exprerienced_ section)]()

If this guide needs any fixes, polishing or additions, if you still don't understand something about
the **EnterpriseException** then feel free to [create an issue]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/issues) with
the _"documentation"_ label! I'll do my best to update this guide so it could become more useful and the library usage
could become more transparent.
