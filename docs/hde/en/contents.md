# HOWTO for dummies and experienced

This guide contains instructions and explanations about the **EnterpriseException** library classes, their basic usage
and their mastering for some complicated cases.

- [Basic usage (the "dummies" section)](dummies/about.md)
    1. [GlobalException](dummies/global-exception.md)
    1. [CustomizableException]()
    1. [Parser]()
- [Mastering enterprise exceptions (the "exprerienced" section)]()

If this guide needs any fixes, polishing or additions, if you still don't understand something about
the **EnterpriseException** then feel free to [create an issue]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/issues) with
the _"documentation"_ label! I'll do my best to update this guide so it could become more useful and the library usage
could become more transparent.
