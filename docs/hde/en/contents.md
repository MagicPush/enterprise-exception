If this guide needs any fixes, polishing or additions, if you still don't understand something about
**EnterpriseException** then feel free to [create an issue]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/issues) with
"_documentation_" label! I'll do my best to update this guide so it could become more useful and the library usage
could become more transparent.
